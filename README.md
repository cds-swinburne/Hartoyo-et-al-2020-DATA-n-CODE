# Implementation of methods employed and datasets used in Hartoyo et al. (2020)
Alpha blocking, a phenomenon where the alpha rhythm is attenuated by attention to a visual, auditory, tactile or cognitive stimulus, is one of the most prominent features of human electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we identify a simple physiological mechanism by which opening of the eyes causes attenuation of the alpha rhythm. We fit a neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 subjects, each showing different degrees of alpha blocking upon opening of their eyes.  Although it is notoriously difficult to obtain reliable parameter estimates from the fitting of such multi-parameter nonlinear models, we show that, by regularizing the inferred parameter differences between eyes-closed and eyes-open states, we can reduce the uncertainties in these differences without significantly compromising fit quality. From this emerges a parsimonious explanation for the spectral changes between states: Just a single parameter, <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$p_{ei}$" border="0" />, corresponding to the strength of a tonic, excitatory input to the inhibitory population, is sufficient to explain the reduction in alpha rhythm upon opening of the eyes. We show how the differential increase in <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$p_{ei}$" border="0" /> across different subjects increases with the degree of alpha blocking. In contrast, other parameters show weak differential changes that do not scale with alpha rhythm attenuation. Thus most of the variation in alpha blocking across subjects can be attributed to the strength of a tonic afferent signal to the inhibitory cortical population, without any need to invoke oscillatory thalamic input or explicit thalamo-cortical feedback. 

A full description of the techniques is described in the following manuscript:
